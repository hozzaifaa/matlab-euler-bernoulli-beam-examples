# MATLAB Euler-Bernoulli Beam Examples

This repository contains a collection of solved examples based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, implemented and documented in Markdown with accompanying diagrams.

## Structure

Each subfolder contains:
- A Markdown file explaining the problem, boundary conditions, and solution.
- Related figures (e.g., shear and moment diagrams).

## Use

These examples are meant to aid in understanding classical structural mechanics problems and can be extended in MATLAB or other tools for simulation and verification.

## Topics Covered
- Fixed-Free beams
- Pinned-Pinned beams
- Fixed-Pinned beams
- Fixed-Fixed beams
- Overhanging beams with roller supports
